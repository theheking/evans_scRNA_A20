Abstract
Background
Evans syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterised by the co-occurrence of two of three autoimmune cytopenias. The condition is often severe, relapsing, and resistant to treatment. Although ES is associated with immune dysregulation, its genetic and molecular basis is not well defined. TNFAIP3, which encodes the anti-inflammatory regulator A20, plays a central role in limiting NF-κB–mediated immune activation. While loss-of-function variants in TNFAIP3 have been linked to autoimmunity and Evans Syndrome, the contribution of non-coding regulatory mutations to ES remains poorly understood.

Objective
This study aimed to characterise the genetic and immunological mechanisms underlying Evans syndrome in a child harbouring a previously uncharacterised TNFAIP3 splice acceptor site mutation (c.-15-2A>G) together with a heterozygous 16q23.3–q24.1 deletion encompassing MBTPS1. We further sought to define how these variants perturb immune cell function through integrated family-matched genomic and single-cell analyses.

Methods
A 4-year-old patient with severe ES underwent family-based genomic and immunologic assessment. Sanger sequencing, bioinformatic modelling, and a mini-gene splicing assay were used to evaluate the functional impact of the TNFAIP3 variant. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from family members were analysed using flow cytometry and family-matched single-cell RNA sequencing, representing the first application of scRNA-seq to Evans Syndrome. 


Results
The TNFAIP3 c.-15-2A>G mutation was confirmed in three family members, including the proband and two of whom had a mild autoimmune phenotype. The proband, the only individual carrying the heterozygous 16q23.3-q24.1 deletion, presented with severe, treatment-refractory ES. Bioinformatic modelling and splicing assays demonstrated loss of canonical splicing and activation of a cryptic acceptor site 41 bp downstream in exon 2, but PBMCs from carriers showed no evidence of alternatively spliced product or nonsense-mediated decay. Flow cytometry established elevated basal CD154, PD-1, and Ki-67 expression in the proband, consistent with T-cell hyperactivation. Single-cell transcriptomics corroborated this finding by revealing shifts in cell-type composition and gene-program responses. The proband showed expansion of NK cells and CD8⁺ T cells and depletion of B and CD4⁺ T cells, and lineage-specific NF-κB pathway remodelling. The deletion of the locus, potentially, suggests a crosstalk between the unfolded protein response.  


Conclusion
This study identifies aberrant T-cell co-stimulatory signalling and cytotoxic skewing as key immune features of Evans Syndrome, aligning with current models that highlight T–B cell interaction and cytotoxic effector activation in autoimmune cytopenias. By linking these immune signatures to a non-coding TNFAIP3 splice variant and 16q23.3-q24.1 deletion, our single-cell data extend the recognised inborn-errors-of-immunity spectrum in pediatric ES and reveal transcriptional evidence of NF-κB dysregulation across immune lineages.
